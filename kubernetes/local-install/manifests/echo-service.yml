#
# This is a simple demo service for testing Kubernetes installation.
# It listens to echo TCP port (port 7) and echoes back anything sent to it.
#
# Install the service by running
#
#     kubectl apply -f manifests/echo-service.yml
#
# Start another container where you can test that network communication works
#
#     kubectl run --rm -it --image alpine alpine -- ash
#
# Use the container to connect to echo service
#
#     telnet echo 6
#
# All lines written to telnet connection should be echoed back.
# You can quit telnet by pressing ctrl-d.
